### **React, Firebase**

**A collaborative platform where multiple people can create and edit content together.** The service is **only available after logging in**. The program has three note colors and the location of the note board and **colors are randomly generated**. A "create" input box is available to create new notes, and created **notes can be edited and deleted**. **To prevent simultaneous editing, an alert message pops up if a user attempts to delete or modify a note** that is currently being edited by another user.

### **Functional Specs**
- **Add** a note
- **Delete** a note
- **Move** a note in x, y
- **Edit** a note
- **Authentication** with Firebase Users
- **Locking a note** for others when one person is editing.
    - Set an alert popup when a user tries to edit or delete an editing note.
- **randomize the color** and set the note color.


### What Worked Well
I created a real-time collaborative note program that is only available after logging in. The program has three note colors and the location of the note board and colors are randomly generated. A "create" input box is available to create new notes, and created notes can be edited and deleted. To prevent simultaneous editing, an alert message pops up if a user attempts to delete or modify a note that is currently being edited by another user.

### What Didn't
I spent comparatively more time on update the position in real-time to show the changing position on the other browser in real time but I managed it.

### Extra Credit
- Add in authentication with Firebase Users
- Locking a note for others when one person is editing. => Set an alert popup when a user tries to edit or delete an editing note.
- try to randomize the color and set the note color.
- Some method of note organization such as show-all. => I did random position when the meno is generated to make more like real time brainstorming & memo won't be generated outside of the noteboard(easy to orgnize and manage notes)
