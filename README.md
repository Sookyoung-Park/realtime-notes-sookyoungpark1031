I created a real-time collaborative note program that is only available after logging in. The program has three note colors and the location of the note board and colors are randomly generated. A "create" input box is available to create new notes, and created notes can be edited and deleted. To prevent simultaneous editing, an alert message pops up if a user attempts to delete or modify a note that is currently being edited by another user.

## What Worked Well
I created a real-time collaborative note program that is only available after logging in. The program has three note colors and the location of the note board and colors are randomly generated. A "create" input box is available to create new notes, and created notes can be edited and deleted. To prevent simultaneous editing, an alert message pops up if a user attempts to delete or modify a note that is currently being edited by another user.

## What Didn't
I spent comparatively more time on update the position in real-time to show the changing position on the other browser in real time but I managed it.

## Extra Credit
- Add in authentication with Firebase Users
- Locking a note for others when one person is editing. => Set an alert popup when a user tries to edit or delete an editing note.
- try to randomize the color and set the note color.
- Some method of note organization such as show-all. => I did random position when the meno is generated to make more like real time brainstorming & memo won't be generated outside of the noteboard(easy to orgnize and manage notes)
